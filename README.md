# MSc Data Science Project Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of projects that I am completing as part of my MSc in Applied Data Science and Statistics at the University of Exeter. The projects cover a wide range of topics, from advanced statistical data analytics to data science, including machine learning, algorithms, and more.

## Projects

### 1. Transforming a Messy Dataset with Tidyverse (RStudio)
In this project, I work with a raw and unstructured dataset, cleaning and transforming it using the **Tidyverse** library in R. The process involves:
- Data wrangling with `dplyr`
- Reshaping data using `tidyr`
- Visualization of cleaned data for insights

More projects will be added as they are completed throughout the course.

## Technologies Used
- **RStudio** (Tidyverse, dplyr, tidyr)
- **Python** (for future machine learning projects)
- **SQL** (for advanced database queries)
- **Tableau** (for data visualization)
