6. [Long-Term Phytoplankton Disruption in the Gulf of Mexico: A Zonal Time-Series Analysis of the Deepwater Horizon Spill](https://github.com/KetchupJL/university-projects/tree/main/Communicating%20Data)
   - **Description**:  This scientific report investigates the ecological and chlorophyll-based response of phytoplankton to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill (2010). Using a 15-year satellite chlorophyll-a dataset (MODISA), the study applies time-series decomposition, spatial anomaly mapping, and statistical zonal comparisons to assess phytoplankton disruption and ecosystem recovery across the Gulf of Mexico. The work integrates ecological literature, satellite monitoring, and data science methods to identify post-spill depression periods and long-term resilience patterns.
   - **Technologies Used**:  
     R (tidyverse, raster, stars, sf), NASA MODISA chlorophyll-a data, Quarto, LaTeX (xelatex), NetCDF
   - **Classification (Machine Learning) methods used**:  
     None. This project used statistical time-series and anomaly detection methods rather than machine learning.
   - **Module MTHM507**:  
     Grade – NA%
