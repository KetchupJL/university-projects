# A. Bayesian Inference


## 1. 
[6 marks] Read in the data, then for each person produce a histogram of that given person’s reaction
 times. The range of the x axis should be the same on each histogram. Visually compare the reaction
 time distributions of schizophrenic and non-schizophrenic individuals. What differences/similarities can you observe? Reference the histograms of specific individuals to support your conclusions.
