The NOAA SSC contacted the HAZMAT Duty Officer who arranged for ""Home Team"" scientific support.  Given the high probability of loss of diesel fuel and lube oils on board the vessel and the possibility of an uncontrolled well blow-out, the SSC requested that the event be addressed as a potential major release.	Weather forecast and trajectory implications were developed by the NOAA HAZMAT Home Team and verbally communicated to the USCG.  Given the forecast on an approaching winter frontal passage and the distance off-shore (25 plus miles), no landfall of oil was forecast for the next several days.  Any diesel fuel released would not persist more than a couple of miles from the release point due to the chemical nature of diesel oil and relative high seas (4-5').  The SSC also consulted with the Texas State SSC relative to trajectory implications.  	At approximately 2100 hrs, the USCG called to update the situation:  The lift boat did explode.  The cause of the explosion is still under investigation.  Six people were injured (broken bones and burns), but at this point, no fatalities.  The sub-sea safety valve was shut preventing any release from the well, and the well was reported to only be producing water at the time of the explosion.  This is still preliminary information, but the USCG was confident that there was no apparent well release based on confirming observations from a USCG vessel on-scene.  The lift boat was damaged, but the fuel tanks were reported to be intact.  Given the updated situation and the low probability of shoreline impacts from any minor release, the NOAA team is standing-down, but remains on stand by.  USCG district 8."

MSO Morgan City requested oil fate and trajectory modeling support in addition to a weather forecast.  The spill was the result of a decoupling (pipe separation) at Mississippi Canyon 538 (N 28? 23.32 Lat. W 89? 27.12 Long.).  The spill volume is reported as 240 bbl.  The spill was reported at 1415 hrs CST and source control by reattachment of BOP was reported at 1800 hrs.  The spilled oil is relatively heavy with an API of only 20.2.  Such oils are generally persistent and often form emulsified oil patties and tarballs which can travel long distances.  Often oil released under such conditions is already emulsified with formation or production water.  Dispersants are being evaluated, but would not be practical for a highly emulsified oil.  Conditions off-shore are good for mechanical recovery, and two skimmers are heading to the location.  Given the distance off-shore, landfall is not predicted over the next 2-3 days.

Crude,,,,1,,77200,1,"At 1159 CST on Friday, 22 January 2000. the NOAA SSC was notified of an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico off the Louisiana coast.  The location of the spill was 60 miles offshore.  The spill resulted when an anchor from a semi-submersible drilling rig dragged across and damaged a 24"" pipeline at both the impact site and at a platform more than a mile away.  Oil was released from both locations.  The water depth was greater than 400 feet.  The initial release volume, based on the amount of oil transferred between the time of the incident and shut in was 1839 bbl.  The line was owned by Equilon Pipeline and identified as part of the Poseidon Pipeline System.  The NOAA SSC relocated to the Shell Command Post at the request of the USCG to support the on-scene incident commander.  Preliminary trajectories suggested that the oil would move west and north.  Landfall was not predicted for several days.  The type of oil was a medium sour crude with an API gravity of 31.5.  Such oils may form persistent tarballs and be transported long distances.  Skimmers were activated.  Given the potential for environmental injury from the spill, dispersants were evaluated and approved under the RRT6 preapproval guidelines by the COTP Morgan City.  The sea state (10-15 knot winds and 4-5 foot seas) was ideal for oil dispersion.  Between 1530 CST and dusk, a total of 3000 gallons were applied (1000 gallons by DC-3 and 2000 gallons by DC-4).  The SMART team from USCG Gulf Strike Team was launched and provided visual monitoring.  Observers clearly observed a dispersant plume and not just surface herding.  It was estimated that 75% of the surface oil had been dispersed.  Dispersant operations ended due to darkness.  During the evening and night, overflights were conducted with both IR and SLAR to maintain contact with the oil.  USCG district 8."

The initial report was only that a well blow-out had occurred and that the rig was evacuated and on fire.  At least one burn injury was reported.  The production was primarily natural gas and condensate.  Condensate is oil co-produced in a natural gas well and can vary greatly in composition.  In response, NOAA HAZMAT began to develop initial trajectory information should a significant or prolong release of oil occur and continue to gather information related to the type of oil produced.  The preliminary tactical trajectory indicated that any significant release would be transported NW toward Cameron, LA (a distance of approximately 35 miles).

The spilled oil was a condensate crude with an API of 38.  The stretch of shoreline from Galveston to Freeport is historically an area with high concentrations of birds.  In particular, the area around San Luis Pass is an important feeding and loafing area for shorebirds, gulls, terns, loons, pelicans, and wading birds.  At the time of the spill, because of the very early spring weather, many birds were staging along the beaches, particularly shorebirds who are feeding to bulk up for the migration to nesting areas.  Though shorebirds have a lower tendency to get oiled (compared to diving birds who spend much of their time on the water surface or diving for prey) they spend a lot of time feeding at the water/land interface where any tarballs that come ashore are likely to concentrate.  With onshore winds, the ultimate fate of any persistent oil was shoreline stranding.  Normally, tarballs on shore are not an issue because they are easy to clean up.  However, because of the high concentrations of birds present in the area of the predicted impact, there was a risk of birds getting oiled.  USCG district 8.  Keyword: boom, Corexit 9500."

The location of the spill was given as 28? 43.5' N by 93? 36.5' W.  This is about 60 miles offshore of Sabine Pass and within a mile of the dividing line between two USCG response zones.  The vessels location is in MSD Lake Charles's Response Zone, but the oil quickly moved into MSU Galveston's Response Zone.  MSU Galveston requested an oil trajectory on 24 Nov. (see Hotline #2) and stated that overflights would be conducted by MSD Lake Charles.  The NOAA trajectory doesn't anticipate any landfall within the next three days (the duration of the trajectory forecast).  In general, given the type of oil, quantity spilled, and current offshore weather and ocean currents, the potential for observable beach oiling is very low.  Nearly half of the oil will evaporate and the rest will form small tarballs.  The later are very persistent and may travel many hundreds of miles, but will probably be so highly spatially dispersed that they will be virtually undetected.  They will be lost among the background tarball population of the Gulf of Mexico.  Tarballs in the Gulf of Mexico are derived from both natural seeps and anthropogenic spills.    NOAA SSC (Henry) will follow up and update the situation when more information is available.  USCG district 8."

Although the BOP had successfully shut the annulus between the drill pipe and well casing, the blind rams failed to shear through the drill pipe that was still in the well casing.  Therefore, oil and gas flowed out of the well, up the drill pipe, and onto the platform where it ignited.  The oil discharge increased after the escaping gas and oil forced the drill pipe out of the well.  The initial fire was extinguished by October 17.

The water depth at the wellhead site is about 50 m (164 feet). The IXTOC I was being drilled by the SEDCO 135, a semi-submersible platform on lease to Petroleos Mexicanos (PEMEX). A loss of drilling mud circulation caused the blowout to occur. The oil and gas blowing out of the well ignited, causing the platform to catch fire. The burning platform collapsed into the wellhead area hindering any immediate attempts to control the blowout. PEMEX hired blowout control experts and other spill control experts including Red Adair, Martech International of Houston, and the Mexican diving company, Daivaz. The Martech response included 50 personnel on site, the remotely operated vehicle TREC, and the submersible Pioneer I. The TREC attempted to find a safe approach to the Blowout Preventer (BOP). The approach was complicated by poor visibility and debris on the seafloor including derrick wreckage and 3000 meters of drilling pipe. Divers were eventually able to reach and activate the BOP, but the pressure of the oil and gas caused the valves to begin rupturing. The BOP was reopened to prevent destroying it. Two relief wells were drilled to relieve pressure from the well to allow response personnel to cap it. Norwegian experts were contracted to bring in skimming equipment and containment booms, and to begin cleanup of the spilled oil.

Approximately 7,000 barrels of oil spilled into the Gulf of Mexico after the vessel's port bow tank ruptured.  As flames engulfed the vessel, the master gave the order to abandon ship.  Forty of forty-six crew members were rescued, three charred bodies were found on board the ship August 17, and three crew members were lost at sea.  Weather at the time was mild with clear skies, wind at 10 knots out of the SW, and seas 1-2 feet.  Apparently, the ship was on autopilot with the radar turned off when the watch was relieved at midnight.  The charts that were in use were not up-to-date and showed no fixed structures on the ship's trackline.  When the radar was turned at 0030, nothing was visible.  At 0045, the radar revealed an object approximately 9 miles away on the starboard side of the vessel.  The Captain of the vessel claimed that he saw no navigational lights on the platform even though a Chevron spokesman said they were functioning properly.  The mate failed to plot the object.  At 0130, the port bow of the vessel struck the eastern side of the platform, opening up a gash 2 feet wide by the length of the bow tank.  The cargo ignited and the fire spread towards 15 drums of lube oil.  An emergency call was made and the ship was abandoned while fire and smoke engulfed the forward port section of the ship.Personnel working on other platforms in the area immediately responded to the accident.  Six utility boats surrounded the Globtik Sun within 30 minutes.  Two Coast Guard cutters and four aircraft arrived on-scene on August 15.  The charred vessel was towed by McAllister Towing to Galveston on August 18.  The Globtik Sun was later sold for scrap.  USCG district 8.  Keyword: Fire, collision, salvage, lightering.."
6211,01/12/1970,"Shell Platform 26; Gulf of Mexico, Louisiana","Gulf of Mexico, Louisiana",28.7667,-90.1667,Oil,Wellhead,Crude oil,,,,1,,,5,"On December 1, 1970, Shell Oil Co. Platform 26 exploded and caught fire.  The platform included 22 production wells with a capacity of 15,000 barrels of crude oil per day.  The flames from the burning platform blazed 400 feet into the air.  The 21-B well, with a 424-barrel per day capacity, ruptured 12 feet above the water.  By December 3, the service crane had collapsed towards the center of the platform at a 60? angle.  Burning oil covered the surface of the water within 50 feet of the platform.  By December 7, well No. 21-B was contributing to 30-50 percent of the fire.  Shifting winds, fog and rough seas slowed response efforts at times.Holes were shot into the tubing of some of the wells to determine whether oil was still being produced.  On January 12, Shell Oil Co. personnel perforated a relief well in an attempt to contain the flow.  On January 20, eight of the wells remained on fire.  Corexit 7664 dispersant was applied to the slick at a rate of 3 barrels per hour.Response operations began moderating on March 1.  A U.S. Coast Guard cutter and helicopter were released from the scene.  Shell Oil Co. officials were required to submit daily pollution reports to the U.S. Coast Guard Captain of the Port (COTP), New Orleans, in advance of any operations that may have increased pollution.  Drilling, capping, and pumping of the wells continued throughout April.  By April 16, the estimated rate of release was 20 barrels per day.  The slick was reportedly staying within a 6-mile radius of the platform, with sheen extending to 12 miles.  The slick was reduced to sheen during the following months as pumping and capping operations continued.Beach surveys were conducted by personnel from the U.S. Coast Guard, Shell Oil Co., the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Louisiana Wildlife and Fisheries, and other local observers.  The only shoreline oiling that resulted from the incident was  between Caminada Pass and Bay Champagne.  The case was closed by the U.S. Coast Guard on May 17, 1971.  The explosion and subsequent fire killed four people and seriously burned 37 others.  USCG district 8.  "
