   - **Description**: A set of problem questions, which required a range of data wrangling, statistical modelling and machine learning methods to solve.
   - **Technologies Used**: Python - (Pandas, Numpy, Scipy-learn, Seaborn and more). Machine Learning methods used: Principle Component Analysis, Autoencoders and Linear Regression.
   - **Module MTHM503**: Grade - 74%


### 3. [Comparative Modelling of AIDS Case Trends Using Poisson and Gaussian Regression](https://github.com/KetchupJL/university-projects/tree/main/Statistical%20Data%20Modelling%20Projects%20-%20MTHM506/Coursework%201%20-%20Practical%20Modelling%20Excersises%20and%20Theoretical%20Problems)
   - **Description**: 
   - **Technologies Used**: R - .
   - **.
   - **Module MTHM506**: Grade - 84%


### 4. [Advanced Statistical Modelling: Inference and Classification](https://github.com/KetchupJL/university-projects/tree/main/Advanced%20Topics%20In%20Statistics)
   - **Description**: This project is divided into two core sections. The first involves fitting a hierarchical Bayesian mixture model to assess cognitive reaction times in schizophrenic and non-schizophrenic patients using MCMC methods in JAGS. The second applies a suite of supervised machine learning techniques to classify simulated data into two groups, evaluating the predictive performance of each model.
   - **Technologies Used**: R â€“ (JAGS, ggplot2, rjags, MASS, class, e1071, randomForest, caret).
   - **Classification (Machine Learning) methods used**: Linear/Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, K-Nearest Neighbours, Support Vector Machines andRandom Forests.
   - **Module MTHM017**: Grade - NA%


### 5. [Quantifying Spatio-Temporal Tuberculosis Risk in Brazil using GAMs](https://github.com/KetchupJL/university-projects/tree/main/Advanced%20Topics%20In%20Statistics)
- **Description**: A independent project assessing TB risk in Brazil using Generalized Additive Models. Focus is on fitting spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal models to identify key covariates and risk structures.
- **Technologies Used**: R (`mgcv`, `fields`, `maps`, `sp`, `gt`, `ggplot2`)
- **Methods Used**: Poisson and Tweedie GAMs, spatial and temporal smoothers, tensor product interactions, model selection using AIC/GCV, risk mapping.
- **Module**: MTHM506
- **Grade**: NA%


### 6. [Long-Term Phytoplankton Disruption in the Gulf of Mexico: A Zonal Time-Series Analysis of the Deepwater Horizon Spill](https://github.com/KetchupJL/university-projects/tree/main/Communicating%20Data)
- **Description**:  
  A scientific investigation into the ecological impact of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill on phytoplankton productivity in the Gulf of Mexico. Using satellite-derived chlorophyll-a data and zonal time-series decomposition, the study analyses seasonal disruption, recovery trajectories, and spatial anomaly patterns across control and impacted regions. Comparative analysis of over 120 additional oil spills is also included to evaluate the exceptionalism of DWH.
- **Technologies Used**:  
  R (terra, sf, stars, dplyr, ggplot2, forecast, patchwork, gt, lubridate, purrr, ggridges, zoo)
- **Classification (Machine Learning) methods used**:  
  None (this project applied time-series decomposition and spatial statistics, not supervised classification)
- **Module MTHM507**: Grade - NA%
