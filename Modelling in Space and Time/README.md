## A comprehensive project on statistical modelling in space and time, spanning three domains:

- **Spatial Modelling (Sea Surface Temperature – SST)**: Explores spatial interpolation using sample variograms, Kriging, and Gaussian Process models (both MLE and Bayesian). Evaluates model fit and predictive performance using 5 withheld SST measurements from the Kuroshio current region.
  
- **Time Series Modelling (Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation – AMOC)**: Fits and compares ARIMA, SARIMA, and Dynamic Linear Models on both monthly and quarterly AMOC data. Forecasts the final 8 months (or 2 quarters) and evaluates predictive accuracy using cross-validation techniques.

- **Spatio-Temporal Modelling (California Daily Temperatures)**: Integrates spatial and temporal methods to predict and forecast maximum daily temperatures in San Diego and Fresno. Uses a spatial Gaussian Process model to interpolate spatial patterns and ARIMA/DLMs for time series forecasting over two 5-day windows.

This project demonstrates flexible modelling of complex spatio-temporal phenomena, blending modern Bayesian tools with classical geostatistics and time series approaches.
