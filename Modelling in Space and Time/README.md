# Advanced Spatio-Temporal Modelling of Ocean and Climate Data  
### *MTHM505 â€“ Data Science and Statistical Modelling in Space and Time Coursework*

This project explores spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal modelling techniques applied to real-world climate datasets. It covers kriging, Gaussian Processes (MLE and Bayesian), ARIMA time series modelling, and Dynamic Linear Models (DLMs), culminating in a comprehensive comparison of predictive performances across different modelling frameworks.

## Project Summary

This analysis focuses on three major objectives:
1. **Spatial Prediction of Sea Surface Temperatures (SST)** using variogram analysis, kriging, Gaussian processes (MLE and Bayesian).
2. **Time Series Forecasting of Atlantic Ocean Circulation (AMOC)** using ARIMA models, SARIMA, and DLMs.
3. **Spatio-Temporal Prediction of California Daily Temperatures** combining spatial and time series methods.

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Empirical and theoretical variogram construction
- Kriging interpolation and Gaussian Process modelling
- Bayesian parameter estimation with discrete priors
- Fitting and diagnosing ARIMA and DLMs
- Forecasting and uncertainty quantification in spatial and temporal domains
- Model comparison using AIC, RMSE, cross-validation, and residual diagnostics

---

## Part A: Spatial Modelling of Sea Surface Temperature (Kuroshio Current)

- Exploratory spatial analysis and sample variogram fitting
- **Ordinary Kriging** using MatÃ©rn and Squared Exponential models
- **Gaussian Process MLE Modelling** with maximum likelihood parameter estimation
- **Bayesian Gaussian Process** with discrete priors over lengthscale and nugget
- Predictions at 5 withheld SST locations and model validation through cross-validation

## Part B: Time Series Modelling of Atlantic Overturning Circulation (AMOC)

### Models Compared
- **ARMA and ARIMA** models for monthly AMOC data
- **SARIMA** models for quarterly-averaged AMOC data
- **Dynamic Linear Models (DLMs)** with trend and seasonal components

### Modelling Enhancements
- Manual differencing and stationarity tests
- Identification of optimal (p,d,q) orders via ACF/PACF interpretation
- Forecasting final 8 months and 2 quarters using both ARIMA and DLM frameworks
- Forecast accuracy assessed via RMSE and residual diagnostics

---

## Part C: Combined Spatio-Temporal Modelling of California Temperatures

- **Spatial Gaussian Process Modelling** to predict temperatures at San Diego and Fresno (13 Dec 2012)
- **Time Series ARIMA Forecasts** for 9â€“13 Dec and 13â€“17 Dec
- Model selection based on forecast performance for 13 December predictions
- Integration and critical comparison of spatial vs temporal modelling approaches
