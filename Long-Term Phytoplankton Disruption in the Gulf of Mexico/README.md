# Long-Term Phytoplankton Disruption in the Gulf of Mexico
### *A Zonal Time-Series Analysis of the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill*

This MSc research project explores the long-term impact of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill on phytoplankton productivity in the Gulf of Mexico. Using satellite-derived chlorophyll-a data and time-series decomposition, the study investigates ecological disturbance patterns and evaluates recovery trajectories across defined spatial zones.

## Project Objectives
- Quantify the long-term chlorophyll-a suppression following the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) event
- Assess seasonal disruption and recovery in phytoplankton productivity (2002â€“2024)
- Compare impacts from DWH against 127 other oil spills across the Gulf of Mexico
- Identify spatial heterogeneity and zonal-level ecosystem response

---

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Application of ecological remote sensing and ocean colour time-series
- STL decomposition for seasonality and disturbance detection
- Spatial zonal mapping and impact zone design
- Handling and processing large-scale NetCDF satellite data
- Comparative event analysis and scientific data storytelling

## Summary of Methods

### 1. Zonal STL Decomposition
Seasonal-trend decomposition (STL) was applied to log-transformed chlorophyll-a time series across three spatial zones: 
- **DWH Core Zone**: highest exposure (>30 days of oil)
- **DWH-Wide Zone**: full 2010 oil slick footprint
- **Offshore Control Zone**: remote, low-impact reference area

### 2. Spatial Residual Anomaly Mapping
Residuals from STL were averaged spatially (2010â€“2014) to visualise zones of suppressed or elevated phytoplankton activity.

### 3. Event-Aligned Spill Analysis
Chlorophyll time series were aligned to 127 oil spill events (2006â€“2021) to assess whether ecological responses similar to DWH were common or exceptional.

### 4. Recovery Trajectory Assessment
Trend slopes post-2010 were analysed using STL-derived components to determine the magnitude and direction of phytoplankton recovery.

## Selected Results
<details>
<summary>ðŸ—‚ Key Insights</summary>

- **DWH Core Zone** exhibited strong chlorophyll-a suppression from 2010â€“2014
- **Post-2015** trends in the core zone remained below baseline, suggesting incomplete recovery
- **Offshore Control Zone** showed stable or increasing productivity throughout
- **No significant impact** was detected for the majority of other oil spills â€” DWH was ecologically unique
- **Residual maps** visualised localised zones of both suppression and anomalous chlorophyll peaks
